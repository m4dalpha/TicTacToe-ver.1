# TicTacToe ver.1 

Tic Tac Toe game written in Python. 
This is my first Project after finishing the Exercise 42 in the book "Learn Python the Hard Way"
The next Exercise 43 was to create a game, and I did not want to create just a simple game using command prompt 
but one that will display a real game so I decided to use pygame and greate a Tic Tac Toe game.
I know the game has to many If statements, which the Author of the book say to avoid it,
Also the code is pretty big and after watching severl videos on youtube how other programers have created their Tic Tac Tbut
game I understood that I could make it smaller, but I had an idea in my mind that I wanted to create 3x3 grid by drawing 4 lines 
and within those 4 lines to place 9 black square picture, and when the user clicks on the picture it replace with X or O picture 
based on user move, the game still have a lot things to improve, but I am proud of myself and I will improve it when I will get 
better at programming.


Things about the game. In order to restart it after someoen wins or draw. Just press the Space button.
